Longtail AMM is Arbitrum's most rewarding AMM, made possible with
Stylus. Longtail AMM leverages Super Assets to reward every on-chain
transaction with yield, whilst remaining the most affordable AMM with
a low gas profile leveraging Stylus.

Stylus is a WASM frontend to the standard EVM stack made available
exclusively on Arbitrum.
