if anyone's interested, i just shared how the different features in the crate cause different entrypoints to the contract to be configured!

[08/24/2024 09:33] bayge
whoops. sorry guys


[08/24/2024 09:33] bayge
let me copy what i wrote


[08/24/2024 09:33] bayge
these features are separate contracts:
```
swaps = []
swap_permit2 = []
quotes = []
positions = []
update_positions = []
admin = []
migrations = []
```


[08/24/2024 09:33] bayge
they are used to compile different implementations of `swap`. the `swaps` feature are these functions:
```/// Swap functions. Only enabled when the `swaps` feature is set.
#[cfg_attr(feature = "swaps", external)]
impl Pools {
    #[allow(non_snake_case)]
    pub fn swap_904369_B_E(
        &mut self,
        pool: Address,
        zero_for_one: bool,
        amount: I256,
        price_limit_x96: U256,
    ) -> Result<(I256, I256), Revert> {
        Pools::swap_internal(self, pool, zero_for_one, amount, price_limit_x96, None)
    }

    /// Performs a two stage swap, using approvals to transfer tokens. See [Self::swap_2_internal].
    #[allow(non_snake_case)]
    pub fn swap_2_exact_in_41203_F1_D(
        &mut self,
        from: Address,
        to: Address,
        amount: U256,
        min_out: U256,
    ) -> Result<(U256, U256), Revert> {
        Pools::swap_2_internal_erc20(self, from, to, amount, min_out, None)
    }
}
```


[08/24/2024 09:34] bayge
```    /// @notice swaps within a pool
    /// @param pool the pool to swap on
    /// @param zeroForOne true if swapping token->fluid token
    /// @param amount the amount of token to swap, positive if exactIn, negative if exactOut
    /// @param priceLimit the price limit for swaps, encoded as a sqrtX96 price
    /// @return (token0, token1) delta
    function swap904369BE(
        address pool,
        bool zeroForOne,
        int256 amount,
        uint256 priceLimit
    ) external returns (int256, int256);

    /// @notice swaps tokenA for tokenB
    /// @param _tokenA the input token
    /// @param _tokenB the output token
    /// @param _amount input amount (tokenA)
    /// @param _minOut the minimum output amount (tokenB), reverting if the actual output is lower
    /// @return amount of token A in, amount of token B out
    function swap2ExactIn41203F1D(
        address _tokenA,
        address _tokenB,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _minOut
    ) external returns (uint256, uint256);``` these functions would delegatecall to those functions

is anyone else getting a error downloading object regarding git lfs when cloning the project?


[08/28/2024 13:35] 0xaleko
@bayge I need help with project building. 

I'm trying to build docker. I m not new in using stylus & rust. 
Have you setup for M1 mac users?


[08/28/2024 13:45] 0xaleko
```docker

    cargo +nightly build \

error: no such command: `+nightly`

        Cargo does not handle `+toolchain` directives.
        Did you mean to invoke `cargo` through `rustup` instead?
make: *** [seawater-admin.wasm] Error 101
```


[08/28/2024 13:55] bayge
your problem is that you have the BSD version of Make, when you need the gnu version 🙂 my advice would be to install gnu make using (going off memory here, bare with me) `brew install findutils`


[08/28/2024 13:56] bayge
then to set up your path in a way that a gnu find alias has priority. also idk about your cargo... did you install it using rustup?


[08/28/2024 13:56] bayge
this is unfortunately an issue that codearena are aware of. i can't pull the repo myself to resolve this issue. tagging the team for visibility...

try using the zip download feature that you can get through github


[08/28/2024 14:01] 0xaleko
I used brew for install


[08/28/2024 14:01] bayge
try using rustup instead and remove what you installed using brew

@bayge What values should these environment variables take?

you could set these to whatever address you want if you're building the code without testing

Can you give more information on how to build it correctly?


[08/30/2024 00:40] bayge
leo isn't related to seawater! 🙂 you need to test exclusively seawater


[08/30/2024 00:40] bayge
try using `make seawater`


[08/30/2024 00:42] bayge (pinned)
hey everyone, if you experience issues with `make build`: use `make seawater` to build longtail exclusively!


[08/30/2024 00:42] bayge

[09/02/2024 15:41] prapandey031
Hi @bayge 
I want your help with the following:

1) The AMM uses a diamond proxy pattern. I assume that the main entry point for the users would be the SeawaterAMM.sol proxy. It would then delegate to different facets, separated as "features" in seawater/src/lib.rs. Am I right?

2) The Readme states that the liquidity is centralised in one contract. I believe it is the SeawaterAMM.sol proxy contract. Moreover, the "pools" mapping (LOC-109) in seawater/src/lib.rs maps from the token address to its pool info. Basically, there's no separate contract for a different pool. Am I right?

Pls confirm


[09/02/2024 16:45] mangoeth
Where do i find the addresses for these contracts?

[09/03/2024 02:54] bayge
you shouldn't need to set these. you don't need to actually build the contract. but you could set that to whatever you want unless you're making a deployment


[09/03/2024 02:55] bayge
`FLU_SEAWATER_FUSDC_ADDR` is a simple ERC20 and can be any ERC20. `PERMIT2_ADDR` is uniswap's permit2 contract


[09/03/2024 02:56] bayge
1. that's correct. there are no extra contracts for pools. and the feature flag controls which implementation is built as wasm. 2. and yep that's correct 🙂

[09/03/2024 02:57] bayge
https://github.com/fluidity-money/long.so/blob/development/pkg/Makefile#L72 when an implementation is built based on the feature flag given, eventually the Makefile is used to rename it to the wasm specific to the feature


[09/03/2024 03:46] prapandey031
I see. Thank you

I could not find this test in the contest repo:

"ethers_suite_uniswap_orchestrated_uniswap_two"

Could you please help @bayge


[09/11/2024 00:17] prapandey031
I hope everything's fine. 
@bayge has not answered for a long time.

@kartoonjoy | C4🎇🎇 could you please take a look?

[09/11/2024 00:18] bayge
your question i just haven't gotten back to yet. the missing testsuite if it's not there i can't comment


[09/11/2024 00:19] prapandey031
It seems it is not there in the repo except the readme


[09/11/2024 00:19] bayge
maybe that's a mistake then


[09/11/2024 00:20] prapandey031
You could provide more info about what that function want to achieve and the portion of the codebase that function tests


[09/11/2024 00:22] prapandey031
Moreover, it would be helpful if you could go through the private threads


[09/11/2024 00:23] bayge
i've been going through the private threads. your question i can't get to immediately


[09/11/2024 00:23] bayge
if there's a missing test it might be a mistake. i can hunt around to find it

I understand the issue now. The test function name is different than what's mentioned in the readme


[09/11/2024 09:48] prapandey031
